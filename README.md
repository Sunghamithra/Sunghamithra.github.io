This repository contains my personal portfolio website, designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as a Full Stack Python Developer. The website is built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, ensuring a clean, modern design with full responsiveness across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

The portfolio includes sections such as an introduction, skills overview, project highlights, and contact details, providing visitors with a clear understanding of my technical background and experience. Bootstrap has been used to create a consistent layout and responsive components, while custom CSS enhances the visual appeal.It adds interactivity and improves the overall user experience.

This project reflects my strong foundation in frontend development and my ability to design user-friendly web interfaces. It also demonstrates my understanding of web standards, responsive design principles, and clean code practices. The portfolio serves as a central platform to present my work and connect with potential employers, collaborators, and clients.
